Three types of materials can be used in additive manufacturing: **polymers, ceramics and metals**.
the goal of ML is the development of accurate predictive models
1. Ứng dụng ML vào AM (addtive manufactoring): Once an ML model is trained, AM users can interrogate the model with various questions, such as “what process parameter set should be used if we require ultimate tensile strength of Y?” or “what is the tradeoff between the different process parameter inputs?” or “which process parameter inputs have a large influence on part density?” This allows the AM user to rapidly develop optimized process parameters. Additionally, by monitoring the AM manufacturing process through testing coupon samples at regular intervals, the model can be further trained to detect process drift as a function of time or other factors (e.g., room temperature, humidity, personnel).
2. applying ML to real-time sensory inputs or measurements, such as using computer vision to monitor in-situ sensors
