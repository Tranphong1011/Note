Additive manufacturing (AM) or additive layer manufacturing (ALM) is the industrial production name for [3D printing](https://www.twi-global.com/technical-knowledge/faqs/what-is-3d-printing "What is 3D Printing and How Does it Work?"), a computer controlled process that creates three dimensional objects by depositing materials, usually in layers.

Three types of materials can be used in additive manufacturing: **polymers, ceramics and metals**.
the goal of ML is the development of accurate predictive models
1. Ứng dụng ML vào AM (addtive manufactoring): Once an ML model is trained, AM users can interrogate the model with various questions, such as “what process parameter set should be used if we require ultimate tensile strength of Y?” or “what is the tradeoff between the different process parameter inputs?” or “which process parameter inputs have a large influence on part density?” This allows the AM user to rapidly develop optimized process parameters. Additionally, by monitoring the AM manufacturing process through testing coupon samples at regular intervals, the model can be further trained to detect process drift as a function of time or other factors (e.g., room temperature, humidity, personnel).
2. applying ML to real-time sensory inputs or measurements, such as using computer vision to monitor in-situ sensors

Machine Learning is about machines improving from data, knowledge, experience, and interaction.” -> we are going to address the concept of improving a machine’s performance from data, knowledge, experience and interaction
The key is being able to turn the massive amount of data generated into useful information to improve the machine’s performance.

Next to the data sets involved, the ability to leverage experience to automatically improve algorithms is key to appreciating Machine Learning

The learning types’ data inputs could be in the form of images, chemistries, sensor data, mechanical property data and volumetric information
